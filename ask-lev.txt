Ask Lev:

- SVO sentence w/o pronouns
- Run made-up sentences by Lev
- -hig- on verbs: is this used for plural common nouns? Does this apply to temporal pronouns as well? And reflexives?
- Order for ditransitive objects? EG:

Shima opakiNpi?shima o= p -ak -i =npifish 3nmS= give -perf -real.i =2O
‘Did she give you fish?’

Is "opakiNpi shima" OK?

How would it look for declarative:

"The tapir gave the man a fish"?

- oketyo onta Oroma nagake.o- ketyo onta Oroma no= ag -ak -i3nm- first this.nm personal.name 1S= take -perf -real.i ‘I first took Oroma (as my spouse).’

can non-clitic pronouns occur resumptively with common nouns and proper nouns? It looks like oketyo is modifying oroma.

- 1st Person Pronoun: is it underspecified for incl/excl or is it excl?


- ditransitives: still only 1 overt NP?
- ditransitives: is 'free np' theme maybe in focus position?
- for 1.PL.INCL subject clitic, must it cooccur with -hig- or -ge- ?
- p. 396 Barentin etc Why no plural???????? Is plural marking on verb not obligatory?
- Adverbs: Can they occur anywhere in a clause? Is there anywhere they cannot occur? (Between determiner/noun, verb/direct object, etc?)
- Nti vs n: As we understand it:
	- Nti
		: instance IS class
	- n
		: instance is not class
		: attribute is noun
		: noun is location
	: is "noun is attribute" attested? we could not find any. (give fake)
		Kirahari oni nosapiro. (p 318)
		Nosapiro oni kirahari. <-- okay?
		: does this verb require the subjective clitic?
