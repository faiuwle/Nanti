Ask Lev:

- SVO sentence w/o pronouns
- Run made-up sentences by Lev
- -hig- on verbs: is this used for plural common nouns? Does this apply to temporal pronouns as well? And reflexives?
- Order for ditransitive objects? EG:

Shima opakiNpi?shima o= p -ak -i =npifish 3nmS= give -perf -real.i =2O
‘Did she give you fish?’

Is "opakiNpi shima" OK?

How would it look for declarative:

"The tapir gave the man a fish"?

- oketyo onta Oroma nagake.o- ketyo onta Oroma no= ag -ak -i3nm- first this.nm personal.name 1S= take -perf -real.i ‘I first took Oroma (as my spouse).’

can non-clitic pronouns occur resumptively with common nouns and proper nouns? It looks like oketyo is modifying oroma.

- 1st Person Pronoun: is it underspecified for incl/excl or is it excl?
